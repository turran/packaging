+ Add support for coveralls.io

+ The token needs to placed on the ENVIRONMENT given that it is not made public
+ Add support for releases. We need to add a nano version, i.e x.y.z.1 for git/svn/cvs whatever
  and 0 for a release. In case such number is 0 or does not exist we can create a new tag
  on git. Later with some github api bin we can create a real release instead of doing
  it manually
